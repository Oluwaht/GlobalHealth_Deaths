# Cause of Deaths around the World (Historical Data 1990-2019)

Welcome to the "Cause of Deaths around the World" dataset â€“ an archive of historical data depicting causes of death across different ages and regions. This collection offers insights into various causes of mortality worldwide. The dataset encompasses a spectrum of factors, including Meningitis, Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, Parkinson's Disease, Nutritional Deficiencies, Malaria, Drowning, Interpersonal Violence, Maternal Disorders, HIV/AIDS, Drug Use Disorders, Tuberculosis, Cardiovascular Diseases, Lower Respiratory Infections, Neonatal Disorders, Alcohol Use Disorders, Self-harm, Exposure to Forces of Nature, Diarrheal Diseases, Environmental Heat and Cold Exposure, Neoplasms, Conflict and Terrorism, Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic Kidney Disease, Poisonings, Protein-Energy Malnutrition, Road Injuries, Chronic Respiratory Diseases, Cirrhosis and Other Chronic Liver Diseases, Digestive Diseases, Fire, Heat, and Hot Substances, Acute Hepatitis, and more. The dataset also includes information about Total Deaths.

## Key Highlights

- The five most prevalent causes of death globally are Cardiovascular Diseases, Neoplasms, Chronic Respiratory Diseases, Lower Respiratory Infections, and Neonatal Disorders.

## Insights by Category

### Cardiovascular

- Notably, Russia has experienced significant improvement in reducing Cardiovascular Diseases over the past five years.

### Malaria

- The burden of malaria is particularly pronounced in Africa and India. Factors contributing to these disparities include limited healthcare access, poverty, climate, and population density.

### Alzheimer's

- Globally, cases of Alzheimer's Disease are steadily increasing. Specific countries with the highest occurrences are of particular interest.

### Self-harm

- While self-harm deaths exhibit slow global change, they are gradually rising in India and markedly declining in China.

### Respiratory

- Although no direct correlation between the two causes of death is apparent, a global upward trend in chronic respiratory deaths contrasts with the relatively stable figures for heat/cold-related deaths.

### Alcohol/Cirrhosis

- No evident connection exists between deaths caused by alcohol-related issues and cirrhosis. Naturally, countries with larger populations tend to exhibit higher rates for both causes.

### Protein Malnutrition

- Encouragingly, global rates of Protein Malnutrition are generally decreasing. No countries indicate a significant increase in these cases.

This dataset is a valuable resource for understanding historical trends in causes of death worldwide. The insights offered can aid in making informed decisions to improve public health and address the challenges associated with various mortality factors.
